# Customer purchase segmentation and retention prediction
This project is a collaboration of the author and an analyst from CoModa, a retail company in Columbia, exploring the patterns in their customer purchase behaviors and if any of their purchase details could predict the customers' returns. 

The analyst from CoModa will extract non-identified details from new customers that were acquired from any marketing campaign in 2022 and track if they ever return until May 2023. Then this report author would use it to perform exploratory analysis and some machine learning methods for the goals listed above.

# Project scope
_ Defining the needs of the business: purchase patterns and retention prediction for customers acquired from promotion campaigns.
_ Defining the target: customers who never purchase before 2022, with the first order containing a discount from Jan to June 2022.
_ Defining the data extraction: all the target first orders details: total values, discount, quantity, products, customer DOB.
_ Data validation and cleaning: anomalies examination, language, and dollar conversion,
_ Data transformation and analysis: aggregate the details of each customer before retention analysis.
_ Clustering and retention prediction: machine learning models (unsupervised and unsupervised).

# Usage
